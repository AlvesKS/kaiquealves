It also is optimized to deal with stratified data.\n\n\n## Shiny apps\n\n###   [*Rusty Profits*](https://alvesks.shinyapps.io/rusty-profits/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n`Rusty profits` is an app that evolved from an [work](https://doi.org/10.1111/ppa.13396){target=\"_blank\"} that I conducted on fungicide profitability for managing soybean rust in Brazil. The app can be used to estimate fungicide profitability given the spraying cost, soybean price, and fungicide control efficacy.\n\n###   [*simDPC*](https://alvesks.shinyapps.io/simDPC/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nSimulate disease progress curved with this app. It is a very good tool for teaching temporal aspects of epidemics, like differing the different types of models used for comparative epidemiology. \n\n###   [*epidemioBR*](https://alvesks.shinyapps.io/epidemioBR/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nHere is where you can find the Brazilian community of epidemiologist. This an repository showing where  and how to find members of our community is located in Brazil.
