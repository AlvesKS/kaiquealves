I am really into the quantitative aspects of epidemics, such as epidemiological models, stochastic simulations, and using modern statistical approaches to link environmental features to disease intensity and occurrence.\n\n## Background\n\nMy background is in quantitative plant disease epidemiology and applied statistics in agriculture. During my undergraduate as an Agronomy student I had the opportunity to work with plant pathologists, engineers, and mathematicians, from whom I got inspired to work with epidemics. During my graduate (M.Sc and D.Sc) at [Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV)](https://www.ufv.br/){target=\"_blank\"} I focused on delving into plant pathology and learning more about epidemiology. I got enveloped in research projects on the epidemiology of several important plant diseases, such as citrus Huanglongbing, soybean rust, Fusarium head blight, Wheat Blast, and white mold. Although I had the chance to learn a little bit about programming during my undergraduate, during graduate school was when I really developed this skill. Today I am I avid R user!\n\n## Personal\n\nWhen not sitting in front of a screen programming or writing manuscripts, I am, well, in front of a screen doing other stuffs. I really enjoy playing and watching computer games. I am also really into watching movies and TV shows.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.370","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"title":"Kaique Alves"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
