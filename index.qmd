## Research Interests

I am deeply interested in plant disease epidemiology. I am really into the quantitative aspects of epidemics, such as epidemiological models, stochastic simulations, and using modern statistical approaches to link environmental features to disease intensity and occurrence.

## Background

My background is in quantitative plant disease epidemiology and applied statistics in agriculture. During my undergraduate as an Agronomy student I had the opportunity to work with plant pathologists, engineers, and mathematicians, from whom I got inspired to work with epidemics. During my graduate (M.Sc and D.Sc) at [Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV)](https://www.ufv.br/){target="_blank"} I focused on delving into plant pathology and learning more about epidemiology. I got enveloped in research projects on the epidemiology of several important plant diseases, such as citrus Huanglongbing, soybean rust, Fusarium head blight, Wheat Blast, and white mold. Although I had the chance to learn a little bit about programming during my undergraduate, during graduate school was when I really developed this skill. Today I am an avid R user!

## Personal

I enjoy playing and watching computer games. I am also really into watching movies and TV shows. Recently I started cycling, which was a challenge in the beginning, but now is one of my favorite outdoor activities.
