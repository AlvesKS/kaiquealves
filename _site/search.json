    "text": "Background\nMy background is in quantitative plant disease epidemiology and applied statistics in agriculture. During my undergraduate as an Agronomy student I had the opportunity to work with plant pathologists, engineers, and mathematicians, from whom I got inspired to work with epidemics. During my graduate (M.Sc and D.Sc) at Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) I focused on delving into plant pathology and learning more about epidemiology. I got enveloped in research projects on the epidemiology of several important plant diseases, such as citrus Huanglongbing, soybean rust, Fusarium head blight, Wheat Blast, and white mold. Although I had the chance to learn a little bit about programming during my undergraduate, during graduate school was when I really developed this skill. Today I am I avid R user!"
