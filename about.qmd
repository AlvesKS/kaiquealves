### Bio

I was born in a small town called Boa Esperança in the state of Espírito Santo in Brazil. I am an Agronomist and D.Sc candidate in Plant Pathology specialized in quantitative plant disease epidemiology. My research is focused in quantitative epidemiology with experience in phytopathometry, temporal and spatial dynamics, yield loss, disease management, and environmental effects on epidemics. The methods I have been applying in my research include stochastic simulations, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, and machine learning algorithms. I am also deeply interested in R, Data Science, and Open Science.
